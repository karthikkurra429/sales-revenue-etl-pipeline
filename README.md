This project implements an end-to-end ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) pipeline to process raw sales data and load it into a PostgreSQL analytics database.
The pipeline cleans, transforms, and aggregates transactional data to support revenue and profitability analysis which helped me to analyse revenue over time, revenue generated by specic product, overall revenue and top 10 customers.
